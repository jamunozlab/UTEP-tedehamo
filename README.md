# UTEP-tedehamo
This code enables high-throughput pipelines for thousands of classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using LAMMPS, where parameters like temperature, concentration, system size, and the presence of point defects are fully automated.

It is an extended version of tedehamo https://github.com/jamunozlab/tedehamo, designed to not only run simulations but also extract mechanical and thermal properties from the MD results. The framework modularizes each step, including the computation of Warren-Cowley parameters and configurational entropy.

A simple example using an Iron-Aluminum alloy is provided to demonstrate functionality.
